# Technical Portfolio

Hi there! This repository hosts my technical portfolio, built using [TechFolio](http://techfolios.github.io). This was originally was used for a class assignment, but I wanted to spend time to polish it up to better suit my needs, and to display the accomplishments I've done. I am still learning how to work with HTML, but I plan to make my portfolio more appealing as I learn more!
